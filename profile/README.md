**Our Mission**: We believe AI4Finance will reshape our financial lives and the open-source community will make sure it's for the better.

**Our Vision**: AI community has accumulated an open-source code ocean over the past decade. Applying these intellectual and engineering properties to finance will initiate a paradigm shift from the conventional trading routine to an automated machine learning approach, even RLOps in finance.
