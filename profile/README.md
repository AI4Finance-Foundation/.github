3. **Accelerating Research and Innovation:** The open-source model fuels progress in research and development within the AI domain.
4. **Enhancing Education:** Open-source FinTech serves as robust educational tools, presenting students and researchers with the prospect of exploring the complexities of FinTech through direct engagement with fully operational models.
5. **Promoting Community Development and Collaborative Engagement:** Open-source endeavors generally reap the benefits of a heterogeneous, global community of contributors.

## Maintain an open-source project at AI4Finance Foundation

Dear developers, 

Thanks for your support!  

If you are interested in working with an open-source community to maintain open-source projects (under MIT Education License) in the intersection of AI/ML, data science, and finance. You may organize a small team at our AI4Finance Foundation, and we can work together on code maintenance.

We are an [open finance community](https://openfin.engineering.columbia.edu/), running by an alliance among Columbia University, New York University, Princeton University, Purdue University, Northwesten University,...(the list is growing).  

We look forward to working closely with you, learning from you, and exchanging information with you!
