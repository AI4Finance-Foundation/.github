## Maintain an open-source project at AI4Finance Foundation

Dear developers, 

Thanks for your support!  

If you are interested in working with an open-source community to maintain open-source projects (under MIT Education License) in the intersection of AI/ML, data science, and finance. You may organize a small team at our AI4Finance Foundation, and we can work together on code maintenance.

We are an [open finance community](https://openfin.engineering.columbia.edu/), running by an alliance among Columbia University, New York University, Princeton University, Northwesten University, IDEA Research, ...(the list is growing).  

We look forward to working closely with you, learning from you, and exchanging information with you!
